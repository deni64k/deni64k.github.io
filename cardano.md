Hello stranger,

I am running a charity staking pool on Cardano with the ticker [`MEOW`](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1ptzt9j6y4jefzkq4vj3z7wa4h492ktlkecggseqvc8f060xuved).
It's called `MEOW` üêà for a reason: I am an avid lover of cats, and have devoted my life to one of them named Jack.

All the rewards I get as the pool's owner (excluding the delegators) are donated to animal shelters. My pool is very small, but the more delegators I get,
the more blocks can be produced and more rewards can be donated.

Donations records:

1. [Elena's animal shelter in Odesa, Ukraine](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100027543013435). Receipts are [here]({% post_url 2022-12-30-cardano-donation-1 %}).
